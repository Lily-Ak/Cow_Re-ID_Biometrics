# Cow_Re-ID_Biometrics
Conducted research and experiments comparing two cow re-identification systems using muzzle images. Created a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) achieving 87% accuracy and an F1 score of 86.7%. Compared this performance against a pre-trained VGG16 model, which achieved 94.4% accuracy and an F1 score. Employed dropout and early stopping techniques to prevent overfitting in the VGG16 model.
